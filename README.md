# DIDComm Messaging Clients Utilities

This repository provides utility components for handling DIDComm messaging in decentralized communication systems. It includes JavaScript client components for mediation coordination and message pickup, designed to work seamlessly with our [DIDComm Mediator-rs](https://github.com/adorsys/didcomm-mediator-rs) implementation.
